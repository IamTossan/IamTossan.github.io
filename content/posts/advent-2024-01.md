Here's the link to [advent of code day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1).

## Part 1

We begin with this example:

```
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
```

Here we need to compute the sum of distances.

A distance is defined as how far apart two numbers in a pair are.

The twist is that the numbers are shuffled and the first pair is the smallest number in the first column and the smallest in the second. The second pair is the second smallest in each column and so on.

In this example, the result would be `(3 - 1) + (3 - 2) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11`.

This is perfect for a TDD approach. So we start by setting up the test:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_distance() {
        let test_data = [vec![3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3], vec![4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]];
        assert_eq!(compute_distance(&test_data), 11);
    }
}
```

We make 3 decisions right away (that we can still change later):

- the data structure
- the function name
- the function signature

We decide to keep an immutable reference for the parameter to avoid the complexity that mutability brings. We'll refactor to `&mut` if we need a boost in performance.

`rust-analyser` is already helping us:

```
assert_eq!(compute_distance(&test_data), 11);
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
```

So we start like this:

```rust
fn compute_distance([xs, ys]: &[Vec<u32>; 2]) -> u32 {
    0
}
```

Then `cargo test` outputs:

```
test tests::test_distance ... FAILED

[...]

assertion `left == right` failed
  left: 0
 right: 11

```

Finally we can start implementing the logic:

```rust
import std::{iter::zip};

fn compute_distance([xs, ys]: &[Vec<u32>; 2]) -> u32 {
    let mut xs = xs.clone();
    let mut ys = ys.clone();
    xs.sort();
    ys.sort();

    zip(xs, ys).map(|(x, y)| x.abs_diff(y)).sum()
}
```

```
test tests::test_distance ... ok
```

Now that the logic is ready, we can pretty much finish the first part.

```rust
fn get_data() -> Result<[Vec<u32>; 2], Box<dyn Error>> {
    let s = fs::read_to_string("src/assets/aoc1.txt")?;
    let mut out: [Vec<u32>; 2] = [vec![], vec![]];
    for l in s.lines() {
        let xs: Vec<&str> = l.split_whitespace().collect();
        out[0].push(xs[0].parse().expect("should be a number"));
        out[1].push(xs[1].parse().expect("should be a number"));
    }
    Ok(out)
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let s = get_data()?;
    println!("distance: {}", compute_distance(&s));

    Ok(())
}
```

## Part 2

Here we have a different logic to compute

| Column x | Column y | count of x in y | x \* count of x in y |
| -------: | -------: | --------------: | -------------------: |
|        3 |        4 |               3 |                    9 |
|        4 |        3 |               1 |                    4 |
|        2 |        5 |               0 |                    0 |
|        1 |        3 |               0 |                    0 |
|        3 |        9 |               3 |                    9 |
|        3 |        3 |               3 |                    9 |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
|          |          |             sum |                   31 |

We add a test

```rust
#[test]
fn test_similarity() {
    let test_data = [vec![3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3], vec![4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]];
    assert_eq!(compute_similarity(&test_data), 31);
}
```

And the matching function

```rust
fn compute_similarity([xs, ys]: &[Vec<u32>; 2]) -> u32 {
    let mut ys_counter = HashMap::<u32, u32>::new();

    for e in ys {
        *ys_counter.entry(*e).or_default() += 1;
    }

    xs.iter().map(|x| x * ys_counter.get(x).unwrap_or(&0)).sum()
}
```

Update the main function

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let s = get_data()?;

    println!("distance: {}", compute_distance(&s));
    println!("similarity: {}", compute_similarity(&s));
    Ok(())
}
```

And we're done!

## Conclusion

This was a pretty straight-forward challenge. Here's some thoughts:

- the shorter the feedback loop, the better, being able to do TDD helped tremendously
- choose the data structure according to the read/write pattern you need
- be careful about when to mutate:
  - in this challenge we could sort the lists in place in the first part without impacting the second
  - we decided to keep the code easy to reason about at the cost of memory
  - in a more "real-world" context, that might be considered differently
